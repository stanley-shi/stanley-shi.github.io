<p>Last Saturday Golfen and I had a visit to two of the four kids, they are Zheng(郑文晴（女）)and Wu(吴征宇（男）). The other two kids, one of them is no longer at Fusheng School now, the other one's cell phone didn't answer. So we only visited the two.  <p>We made a appointment with the two kids on Friday evening. First we went to Wu's home at two o'clock. His home is not far from our new company's address. His parents host a small printing store in their living room. The place is quite easy to find--comparing with the latter one, which I will describe later.  <p>Wu has a younger sister, who is only four years old. When we got there at about 1:50, they just finished their lunch. The boy cleaned up the dishes and the desk, and then we started talking with his father. They are from Hunan province, and they have been on this printing stuff for about two or three years. According to the boy's studying, he said he likes Math best, and also Chinese Language, generally scored at about 85. When being asked about English, the boy said that he doesn't like English very much, maybe just because he is not good at English. And definitely he is not good at English. His father said his last semester's English score is 60, and maybe that's a little too high for the boy, because he didn't know much words. When we asked him to read a few sentences, he said he can't, 'cause there were so many words he didn't know how to pronounce, he just know a few simple words just like "I", "you". So Golfen taught the boy some English words about how to pronounce and what's the meaning of the words. And then the boy asked us a problem on Math, the boy said it's a little hard for him. Golfen solved the problem very quickly :), he is a smart guy :). Then the boy did the problem by himself, and a few similar problems, we could see that the boy is very smart. And also the boy's father mentioned that once there was a student from Fudan University who had been volunteered to teach the boy.  <p>When we were about to leave, the boy's father came back with two bottles of water, we refused that :)  <p>After leave the boy's home, we had a long ride by bike to the girl's home, it cost us nearly one hour to get there :(, and it’s too far away from the school. When we arrived at the place on the list, the place were under construction, so Golfen called the girl's father, he said they had moved to another place, and he just told us the place, and told us how to get there. When we got the place he told us, there was a road under construction, it was all in a mass there, and we still couldn't find the place. After asking some people about the girl's name, we finally found the girl's family. It's a small house, about 5 or 6 square meters, with two beds in, there were hardly any place for us to sit down. When talking with the girl's mother, we knew that they had just move to the place for about a half year, the girl's father ride motorbike for a living, the girl has a younger brother, and they came from Anhui province. When asking the girl about her studies, the girl was a little too shy to answer our questions, mostly the girl's mother answer our question. The girl only talked a little, typical rural girl. In fact, the boy, Wu, had mentioned that the girl's study is not very good. When asking the girl about her English study, she said that she could not catch up on the teacher. And she went to Fusheng School just from last year, and she had never study English before she went to Fusheng. We noticed that she had every word with phonetic symbols, but when we ask the girl to read a few words, she said she did not know how to pronounce the words. She didn't know how to pronounce the symbols. We taught the girl a few symbols, and try to convince the girl that learning English is an easy job. And by the way, the girl's parent had bought her a tape-recorder for her English learning.  <p>When we left there, it was a little late, and the girl's mother, for politeness, asked us to join supper with them :)  <p>Generally, the visiting was a success. </p>
