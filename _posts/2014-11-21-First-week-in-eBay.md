# First Week In eBay

I just joined eBay (Shanghai) this Monday. 

## General impression
The first impression is: it is really far from my home. If I drive, 40 KM; if I take public transportation, 90 minutes minimum. One small good side is that I can always find a seat at somewhere in line 2 on my way back.

Then on day 2, I found another benefit: there's free breakfast here. Although they said you have to go to office early to get it, but it DOES offer breakfast. And I am luck (or not) that out team need to get to office earlier than others(and can leave a little earlier), so I get four breakfast this week. I didn't get the breakfast on Monday because I went ot the other office for some HR related staff.


## About people
People are nice here, I get to know everyone on the first day and only missed one guy because that guy is on travel. I am not mentioning the names here but they are really nice guys.

## About work
I have not really touch the work yet. Just went through the docs and got some basic idea of the data flow and the working processes. Checked out code and did a quick went through, seems not very hard. I think the really hard thing for me now is to understand the business.

Another thing to mention, seems the team really is using TeraData, I even need to have a TeraData certification ASAP. 
Hope to know more soon!

## Misc
I have three computer here, one Mac, one dell workstation and one dell notebook; and the workstation has two big screen, looks good!!
