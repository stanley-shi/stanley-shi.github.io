<p>Currently in a phrase of investigation, a lot of tools and techniques, including:</p>  <p>1. Atom feeds</p>  <p>2. SRM (VMware)</p>  <p>3. VISDK (VMware)</p>  <p>4. ADM (EMC)</p>  <p>5. ESB</p>  <p>6. Smarts</p>  <p>7. Some tools that are not official</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Today I did some investigation on the Atom Feeds.</p>  <p>Atom Feeds is a alternative to the RSS feed that has been widely adopted around the Internet. It is defined by the IETF.</p>  <p>First of all, it includes two parts: the Atom syndication format and the Atom publishing protocol.</p>  <p>From the format part, you can refer to IETF web site to the detail format of this. One thing I think need users to pay attention is that it support MIME resources as the content.</p>  <p>From the protocol part, the Atom Feed use http as the underlying transport. Using the standard Get, Post, Put, Delete to operate on the resources.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Resource link:</p>  <p>Atom standard on WIKI: <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29</a></p>  <p>The Atom syndication format: <a title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287</a></p>  <p>The Atom publishing protocol: <a title="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html" href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html">http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html</a></p>
