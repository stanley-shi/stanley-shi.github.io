<p>Java uses its <em>keytool</em> to manage the certificates.</p>  <p></p>  <p>The mostly used command is like this:&#160; </p>  <p><em>keytool –import –file {yourserver.pem} –keystore {youkeystorefile} </em></p>  <p></p>  <p>where {youserver.pem} is the certification file from your server, and {yourkeystorefile} is the file you used to save the keystores.</p>  <p>Note: the default password for the jdk default keystore file (normal this file located as “$JRE_HOME/lib/security/cacerts”) is “changeit”.</p>  <p>For more information about the <em>keytool</em> command, you can refer to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html">this page</a>.</p>
