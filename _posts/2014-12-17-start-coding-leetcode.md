## Leetcode and Projecteuler

Recently I have found or say re-discovered the fun of programming, so I started working on [leetcode](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/) problems and also working on solving problems at [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/), both are quite interesting sites. 

I will post the solutions later on this blog. Maybe daily or less often, based on my spare time.

The solution code can also be found here: [https://github.com/stanley-shi/learning/tree/master/leetcode](https://github.com/stanley-shi/learning/tree/master/leetcode)
