This is a new site used to blog my technology life. The main focus of this site is the various technologies that I used in my daily worklife.<br />Because I'm working in some company's CTO Office and mainly uses java, so the title is "Java at the CTO Office".<br />Hope I will have a bright future.<br /><br />-Stanley Shi, Aug 7th, 2009
