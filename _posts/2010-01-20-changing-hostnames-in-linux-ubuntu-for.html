<p>How to change the hostname for your Ubuntu machine?</p>  <p>To answer this question, first I need to know what is my hostname?&#160; Type the command “hostname –fqd”, it will tell you.</p>  <p>To temporarily change it, “hostname {your name}”;</p>  <p>if you want to make this change permanent, you need more. First change the content of the file “/etc/hostname” to your host name, then “/etc/init.d/hostname.sh start”.</p>  <p>Note that you may need super user permissions.</p>  <p>Another way is use the “sysctl” command: “sysctl kernel.hostname={your name}”, not sure the detail use, check “man sysctl”.</p>
