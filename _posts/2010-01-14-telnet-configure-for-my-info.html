<p>Today I encountered an error, when I tried to telnet to some windows machine, I got this error “Failure in initializing the telnet session. Shell process may not have been launched.”</p>  <p>I checked the configure of&#160; the remote host and see that the telnet service has been started, so why failure?</p>  <p>I tried Google and found this solution: because if you telnet to this session, you are trying to make another logon, so you have to enable the “secondary logon” service.</p>  <p>I did that, and wow~, success !</p>
